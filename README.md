# Rhythm Fusion: Synchronizing Audio and Motion Features for Music-Driven Dance Generation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Rhythm Fusion**. This repository provides sample videos showcasing dance sequences generated by our model and other existing models, including **FACT**, **Bailando**, and **EDGE**. The purpose of these comparisons is to highlight the performance improvements achieved by our approach in music-driven dance generation.

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance Comparison

Below is a summary of key performance metrics comparing our model with other state-of-the-art models:

| Model          | PFC (â†“) | FID (â†“) | Beat Score (â†‘) |
|----------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| FACT           | 2.25     | 23.11    | 0.22            |
| Bailando       | 1.75     | 24.82    | 0.23            |
| EDGE           | 1.53     | 23.08    | 0.27            |
| **Our Model**  | **0.98** | **22.89** | **0.29**       |

- **PFC**: Per-frame consistency (lower is better)  
- **FID**: FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (lower is better)  
- **Beat Score**: Alignment of generated dance with musical beats (higher is better)

Our model achieves improved performance across all key metrics, demonstrating better synchronization and more realistic dance generation.

## ðŸŽ¥ Qualitative Results

To access the qualitative results in video format, please refer to the **Samples** directory in this repository. The videos provide side-by-side comparisons of dance sequences generated by:

- **FACT**
- **Bailando**
- **EDGE**
- **Our Model**

These samples are presented in 2D representations, making it easier to visually compare the generated movements and synchronization quality.
